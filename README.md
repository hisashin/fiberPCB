## Why fiberPCB?
* Chemical etching : Cheap but need skills for small pitches like 10 mil (0.25mm). Harmful to the environment.
* CNC milling : Required time and cares are proportionate to the complexity of the pattern.
* Commercial PCB laser machine : Ridiculously expensive. "Entry model" [LPKF Photolaser ST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMgXvRwbaLw) is over USD100,000.

## All required tools and expendables
* Gerber Files
* Fiber Laser
* EZCAD
* [FR-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FR-4)
* Laminator
* Dry film
  * I first thought that Kapton film can replace it but that would be wrong.
 
## How to choose fiber laser
 * Stronger/Wider is not always better

## How to choose laminator
 * List confirmed to support 1.6mm thickness

## Detailed steps to make fiberPCB
 * Export Gerber Files
 * Convert files for EZCAD
 * Cut patterns
 * Print solder mask
 * Open pads
 * Cut holes and contor
