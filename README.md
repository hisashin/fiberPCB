All knowledge memo to make PCB with fiber laser

* Why fiberPCB
 * Chemical etching : Cheap but need skills for small patterns. Harmful to the environment.
 * CNC milling : Time and cares are proportionate to the complexity of the circuits.
 * Commercial PCB laser machine : Ridiculously expensive. "Entry model" [LPKF Photolaser ST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMgXvRwbaLw) is over USD100,000.
